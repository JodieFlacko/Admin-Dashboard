# Admin-Dashboard

In this project of The Odin Project course (Intermediate HTML and CSS), I realized a simple yet impactful page using only grid layout mode. Every button works as intended and I even managed to make the page responsive-ish.
I then added basic styling to the elements to make them much more visually appealing.
